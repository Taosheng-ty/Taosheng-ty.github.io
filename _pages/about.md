My name is Tao Yang (杨涛, in Chinese). I am now a fourth year PhD student at school of computing,  University of Utah. My supervisors are Prof. [Qingyao Ai](https://ir.aiqingyao.org/home) and Prof. [Jeff M Phillips](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~jeffp/).

My research mainly focuses on Information Retrieval and Machine Learning related topics. Currently I'm working on applying deep learning techniques on IR problems including product search/recommendation and learning to rank.
